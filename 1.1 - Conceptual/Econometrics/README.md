## Machine Learning vs. Econometrics

* **Machine Learning** is all about maximizing out-of-sample prediction
* **Econometrics** is all about finding "unbiased" and "consistent" parameter estimates (e.g. making sure that the estimated parameters of the model will converge to their "true" population values given a large enough sample size)
* **Machine Learning** is all about finding y&#770;
* **Econometrics** is all about finding &beta;&#770;
