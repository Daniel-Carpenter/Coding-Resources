## Inheritance and Polymorphism

### Intro
* Can have multiple classes in one `.java` file

### `protected`
* On a UML it has a `#` in front of it
* private 



### `superclass` vs. `subclass`
* `superclass` * or `base class`*
	+ base class, which is the constructed object
	
* `subclass *or  `derived class`*
	+ class that is derived from another class, called a base class (or *superclass*).
	+ declared by placing the keyword extends after the derived class name, followed by the base class name. 
	+ Ex: `class DerivedClass extends BaseClass { ... }` 

### Overloading vs. Overriding
* `Overload` = same name but different *paramter list*
* `Override` = method that has the same name, parameters, and return type as a base class's method
