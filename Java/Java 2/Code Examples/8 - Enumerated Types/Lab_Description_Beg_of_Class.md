* Lab Mainly w/Inheritance
	
## New Topics:

1. Derived from abstract and non-abstract classes
2. Implement Interfaces
	

## `Shape Class`
* `nextID` is static because o underlined
* Assign construct to ID
* Increment the static variable
	
## `Circle`
* Implements all abstract class (italicized)
* Overried the abstract ones of shape for specificto circle

Interfaces	
* `Shape` implements `comparable`
* `ShapeIDComparator` - sorts `Shape`s by their `ID`
